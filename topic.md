The Marines’ Hymn commemorates the first battles
In 1847 the Marines took part in the Mexican-American War, during which they took Chapultepec Castle in Mexico City.
The Marines’ Hymn is very well known and starts with the line, “From the Halls of Montezuma,” which refers directly to this battle.  The next words are, “To the shores of Tripoli,” which refers directly to the First Barbary War and the defeat of the City of Derna.
